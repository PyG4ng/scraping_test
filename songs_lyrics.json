    "\"GRIOT\"S LAMENT\" applies Michael Jackson's lyrics to the artists' ongoing exploration of metamorphosis as a threshold of change, and as medium for identifying political and social injustices . \" An innocent black man was killed, and we are that injustice\" sang Michael alongside his sister Janet in the song SCREAM. I use \"recontexualization\" of these lyrics to revisit the killings of Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, and the countless number of innocent youths that have fallen prey to violence in Southwest Chicago. \"They don't care about us\" was shouted as a veiled response to the Rodney King beating , but could it have also been a foretelling or foreshadowing of the tragic humanitarian failures incurred during Hurricane Katrina? One violent scene in the film will be staged to replicate the horrific Rodney King beating. The film asks the question, as Michael did repeatedly via his music: How culpable are WE... when society cannot fully function in the realm of justice? The character \"Griot\" is the conduit for Michael's often overlooked and under recognized political orientation, a perspective that is often over shadowed by the glow and power of his popular music and larger than life persona. \"Griot\", pictured here and played by actor Brandon Hirsch, is a one man Greek chorus; \"A broken ear witness to unspeakable crimes \". I am blessed and grateful to have an amazing crew and unbelievably talented cast whose creative currency will super charge every pixel of every single frame. As a team of artists, we are especially excited about hiring (with the help of our partners) local youth from Inglewood and South Central Los Angeles to work on the film, so that they can benefit from the experience of participating in a local professional film production.  Formerly incarcerated Youth from my non profit  FYI FILMS  Films by Youth Inside,  which empowers incarcerated youth via story telling  and digital film making worked as both talent and crew on this GL! ! Lastly, I'm grateful to have the support of  Black Hollywood Education Resource Center. I began writing Griot's Lament the night that Michael left us. In my heart , it is my sincere hope that Griot's Lament is a fitting tribute to the King of Pop, whose music is the soundtrack to much of my life.",
    "Mini Review of Griots Lament by Akello Stone",
    "\"These days we are bombarded with lots of visual media, stories and messages in the forms of videos. Most of it is completely unimaginative but Griot's Lament is much different It truly is a short-form \"theatrical experience on the small screen\" that evokes thoughts with the kind of intellectual depth, auditory stimulation and cadence, and visual creativity that many of us so desire. It truly captures the wonder, the suspense, the social commentary that can draw you in and leave you sitting - wanting more.\" Bravo!",

    "Pop music (a term that originally derives from an abbreviation of \"popular\") is usually understood to be commercially recorded music, often oriented towards a youth market, usually consisting of relatively short, simple songs utilizing technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes. Pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of popular music, but as a genre is particularly associated with the rock and roll and later rock style.The phrase \u201cpop music\u201d was first coined around the middle of the 1920\u2032s, it meant a piece of music had \u201cpopular\u201d appeal. Numerous things that took place during the recordings of the 20\u2032s could be seen as being the start of the modern day pop music industry, which includes rhythm and blues music, as well as, country, folk, and others.",
    "Pop music has been a profitable industry in America since the 19th century, but Early Pop/Rock is a style that took shape in the post-rock & roll era, once the more conservative elements of the record industry had come to terms with the new musical landscape. Popular culture is distributed across many forms of mass communication including newspapers, magazines, radio, television, movies, music, books and cheap novels, comics and cartoons, and advertising. It contrasts with high cultural art forms, such as opera, classical music and artworks, traditional theater and literature. In mass communication, the term popular culture refers to messages that make limited intellectual and aesthetic demands through content that is designed to amuse and entertain audiences.",
